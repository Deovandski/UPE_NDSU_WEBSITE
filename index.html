        <h2>About UPE</h2>
        <p>Upsilon Pi Epsilon is an honor society whose members are among the most outstanding undergraduate and graduate Computer Science, Management Information Systems, and Software Engineering students at NDSU.  UPE holds events for members and students aiming to help them gain the skills and information that will help them both during their time at NDSU and in their continuing professional lives.  Members of UPE are encouraged to grow in their understanding of the discipline by mentoring and tutoring newer students.  Frequent tech talks sponsored by UPE made by many different types of companies expose NDSU students to many exciting topics outside of the classroom.  Company events provide networking opportunities for students to help them get their feet in the door through internships and research opportunities.  Scholarships are offered through the UPE organization to members in order to encourage our continuing excellence.  The overall mission of Upsilon Pi Epsilon is to recognize academic excellence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the Computing and Information Disciplines.</p>
        <h3>What we do</h4>
        <p>Upsilon Pi Epsilon events include student mentorship, tech talks, professor talks, and company information sessions.  Members both learn and teach through becoming mentors of incoming underclassmen. Tech talks aim to get students excited about innovations and current technologies.  Company information sessions make students aware of the wide range of opportunities that are available to them, ranging from startups to small companies to grad school to government agencies to huge corporations.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting involed</h4>
        <p>If you would like to get involved with UPE as a member, watch out for emails about events we need volunteers for. Helping out with setting up events, being a mentor, or other things we might need gives you opportunities to build contacts with people in industry as well as people in UPE. All members are also eligible to become officers and elections are held every Spring.
